>-----------
>My paper Subnets of proof-nets in MLL with Mix, MSCS vol 7, 1997,
>pp.663-699 has Section 4 dedicated to FILL + Mix.  The par-left rule
>is at page 690-1, and the general method of proof is to decorate
>classical proof-nets with polarizations (called then I-O-orientations)
>that represent an intuitionistic proof.
>
>Cut-elimination is proved by reduction to the cut-elimination
>procedure for proof-nets for MLL with Mix.
>
>The main theorem (Theorem 4, p.695) has the familiar form of
>sequentialization theorems; the proof of cut-elimination for FILL+ Mix
>is parts (c) and (d)
>
>Theorem: There is a context forgetting map ( )- from sequent
>derivations to proof nets with polarization such that
>
>(a) sequent derivations D decorated with terms are mapped to
>proof-nets N with polarization;
>
>(b) sequentialization for proof nets with polarization: if N is a
>polarized proof-net for FILL + Mix then there is a proof with term
>assignment D in FILL + Mix such that (D)- = N;
>
>(c) if D reduces to D' then (D)- reduces to (D')-
>
>(d) if (D)- = N and N reduces to N' then there exists D' such that D
>reduces to D' and (D')- N'.

>There may be a question whether there are gaps in the proof.

>In the case of FILL, a challenge was to find a graph theoretic
>condition for the correct representation of intuitionistic

>Now the last paragraph of the paper checks precisely that

HE: I modified the draft to account for this correction.  We now
acknowledge his paper and his proof.

* Review 1 * 

>In "Multiple Conclusion Intuitionistic Linear Logic and Cut
>Elimination" the authors give a cut-elimination proof for a sequent
>calculus for Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic (FILL) originally
>suggested by Bellin (communicated in a 1996 paper by Bierman
>[3]). They also show that a particular model of FILL, Dial_2(Sets), is
>an linear/non-linear model in the sense of Benton [1].
>
>This paper has a number of serious flaws and my recommendation is that
>it should it be rejected.
>
>First, sequent calculi with cut-elimination for FILL are now
>well-established - the authors cite [3,4], but there is also Clouston
>et al's 2013 'Annotation-Free Sequent Calculi for Full Intuitionistic
>Linear Logic', which is not cited. If yet another such calculus is to
>be added to the literature there needs to be some justification -
>i.e. that it is a better or interestingly different approach to the
>now-solved problem. No such justification is offered.
HE: Fixed, added this to the related work section.

>Second, the authors frame their contribution as a proof of a
>'conjecture' by Bellin that his alternative par-left rule yields
>cut-elimination, but this is not my reading of the Bierman paper that
>introduced it. In that paper Bierman states as a fact, rather than a
>conjecture, that Bellin's rule "leads to a system which is also closed
>under the process of cut elimination". This suggests the existence of
>a proof; admittedly the proof was never published, but this is
>explicable because Bierman had his own calculus which solved the
>problem - he discusses in section 3 of his paper why he prefers his
>pattern-based solution. So it seems likely that the bulk of this paper
>is, at best, recreating an already known proof.
HE: This has been fixed.  We now attribute Bellin with a proof, but
ours is direct.

>Third, the term assignment system in this paper is used entirely to
>track a binary relation between premises and conclusions, in order to
>block illegitimate uses of the IMPR rule. This is the viewpoint made
>explicit by Bra¸ner and de Paiva in their 1998 paper [4]. If you strip
>away the terms from the calculus in this paper, leaving only the
>information of which variables appear free in which terms, then it
>seems to me that you get exactly the Bra¸ner-de Paiva
>calculus. Certainly the PARL rule, which is the focus of this paper,
>is the same (see Definition 3 and Figure 1 of [4]). So the
>cut-elimination result in this paper should be derivable immediately
>from the result of [4].

HE: This seems to me to require additional relations just as it does
in the paper the reviewer cites.  Also, this would be a relative
cut-elimination proof.  It is obvious that there would be a
relationship between the different flavors of FILL.  The direct proof
given here can also be seen as a means of checking the correctness of
our system.  Stripping things away could lead to a false result by
stripping away the problems.  This latter point is important for
future work.

>Fourth, the cut-elimination proof in this paper (and in the extended
>version online) has a gap: it is not explained how Theorem 4 yields
>Corollary 5, and indeed the theorem does not seem to be strong
>enough. For example (\lambda x.e)e' = [e'/x]e by BETAFUN, but if x is
>not free in e and e' has some free variables, then the left hand side
>has more free variables than the right. Therefore the left could block
>IMPR rules that the right would not, so mere equality is not
>sufficient to ensure that the cut-elimination transformations preserve
>the validity of derivations. This can probably be fixed, but it is a
>gap as stands.
HE: This is only a problem when moving from right-to-left accross an
equality t = t'.  However, cut-elimination still goes through when
the equality rules are taken to be left-to-right rewrite rules.  So,
the problem outlined by the reviewer does not affect cut-elimination.

>Fifth, Section 4 (which is entirely unrelated to the earlier sections)
>also makes a very modest contribution. Dial_2(Sets) is known from de
>Paiva's thesis [6] and the paper with Hyland [9] to be a categorical
>model of FILL. If one ignores par and its unit it is not greatly
>surprising that it also conforms to a certain categorical model of
>intuitionistic logic.
HE: It would still be linear, and would be a model of ILL.

> The technical step required to make this small
>jump (the proof that a certain comonad is monoidal) is omitted from
>this paper but described as "straightforward". In fact the situation
>is even more straightforward than suggested, because Dial_2(Sets) is
>also a model of classical linear logic, and so only a model of FILL in
>a degenerate sense, as par can be defined via de Morgan
>duality. Briefly, if \alpha is as in the paper, \alpha lollipop \bot
>is (isomorphic to) the relation from X to U that holds for (x,u) iff
>(not u\alpha x). That double negation is an isomorphism is then
>obvious. Note that the 'G' construction when applied to an arbitrary
>cartesian closed category always yields a FILL model, but does not
>always yield a classical linear logic model, and so from the FILL
>perspective Dial_2(Sets) is not such an interesting example of the 'G'
>construction.

HE: The reviewer is mistaken. I will add some remarks in the paper
clarifying that Dial2(Sets) is a non-trivial model of FILL.

>The remaining comments are more minor.
>
>Page 3, "The first formalization of FILL with cut-elimination was due
>to Bra¸ner and de Paiva [4]": I'm not sure what 'formalization' means
>here; the first published cut-elimination theorem for FILL is in
>Bierman [3].
HE: No! Bierman did ILL, not FILL.

>Definition 3: the third case should contain the word 'otherwise' to
>distinguish it from the first two.
>
>Figure 1: 'IL' and 'IR' should be 'TL' and 'TR'.
HE: I have plans to fix this, but I need to patch Ott first.

>Page 5: "over come" should be "overcome".
HE: Fixed.

>Theorem 9: the 16th page of a 15 page long paper is cited!
HE: Fixed.  We were citing Benton's CSL extended abstract, but we
should have been citing his tech. report.

>Section 4 generally: this section appears to be heavily padded with
>well-known material. Why is it necessary to give full details of two
>different notions of categorical model of intuitionistic linear logic
>if they are known to be equivalent? Why is the proof of Theorem 9
>given if it is already published in [9]?
HE: This is to make the paper self contained.  All of the references
are acknowledged.  I am not convienced this is a bad thing.  Furthermore, these proofs are short sketches and are far from complete.

* Review 2 * 

>A well-written paper but reads more like a review of a whole logical
>development with a small increase in knowledge than a complete result
>that gives new insight. Yet, it is quite nice to read how the ideas
>have evolved, and how a coherent whole picture can be built by
>incremental contributions - therefore a nice "meta" level paper on
>research.

HE:  This is nice, and I think this is what we were going for.

>However, it is also difficult to tease out the contributions
>as they are emershed in the tutorial exposition.

HE: I am not sure how to fix this.  Maybe a comment at each new
contribution with *this is new*?  We do have a *contributions*
section, is this not doing the job?

>I question any wide interest in this programme of work, but putting
>this aside, I still feel it should be presented because it brings
>together many srteams of interest to WOLLIC: Dialectica (By the way,
>is Dialectica capitalized or not? Keep consistent use),
HE: Fixed this.

> linear logic, and category theory.

>Overall well written, though some comments on writing below. By the

>references and call it wollic15.pdf. Maybe give it a different name,
>as at the moment both this submission and that report have same name,
>which made me think it was a self-reference.

>I found the Case of the second hypothesis at the bottom of 6 / top of

HE: Fixed.

>page 2: remove "in" from "FILL in to regain"
HE: Fixed.

HE: Fixed.

HE: Fixed.

HE: Fixed.

>"one only need to start" should be "needs"
HE: Fixed.

HE: Fixed.

* Review 3 * 

>This paper fills in a gap existing since the proposal of FILL: cut
>elimination for the system.
>
>It turns out that the original system lacks cut-elimination and all
>other attempts, typing the system etc, failed.
>
>The problem is that, on allowing the par on an intuitionistic linear
>system, one loses control of resources. The immediate solution of
>restricting the implication right rule does not work as in the
>intuitionistic logic, exactly because the par has this
>"conjunction-disjusnction" flavour, not existing in intuitionistic
>logic.
>
>The solution adopted was mentioned by Bellin and implemented in this
>paper.
>
>It is this referee opinion that the work is interesting enough for a
>workshop like Wollic. But other than a historical importance, it is
>not clear why to adopt an intuitionistic setting with par, since it
>complicates a lot the system.

HE: Nothing really to change with respect to this review.  Perhaps we
can think about motivating the par in the future.
