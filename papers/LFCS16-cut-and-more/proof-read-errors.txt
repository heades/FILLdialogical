On page 6, definition 3, the symbol between "x" and "-" has been changed.  It now looks like a cursive "B", but it should be an up-side-down ampersand.  For example, this symbol should match the symbol in the same spot as the rule called ParL in Figure 1.  The latex for that symbol is \parr in the package cmll at http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/cmll.pdf.  This same problem is repeated in definition 7 on page 9, and definition 8 on the same page.  Again, this same problem is in Definition 12.

There was an author query asking for the full citation for reference 17:
